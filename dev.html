    <h2> Design Criteria:</h2>

    <p>
      Before designing Malariaway, we first had to set out our design criteria. We focused on 4 factors (parentheses signifying ideal result): 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Cost (<2500)- Keeping costs low is important, so that we can get Malariaway to the people who need it</li>

      <li> Side effects (Mild or less) - Minimizing side effects is important, so that we can ensure the best experience for Malariaway users</li>

      <li> Total Parasite Population (TPP) Change (Decrease) - TPP is a strong indicator of how effective of a drug is; a decrease in TPP indicates the drug is effective</li>

      <li> Parasite Drug Resistance (<20%) Over time, due to a process known as natural selection, the parasites for malaria gradually develop resistance to antimalarial drugs; minimizing resistance is important so that
      Malariaway can remain effective
     </li>
    </ul>

        We chose to use a combination of three drugs, to improve effectiveness. The drug regimen is pictured above - the patient takes a large dose of drug A on days one and seven, 
        a small dose of drug c on days two, three, five, and six, and a small dose of drug b on day 4. Our design costs $2,500 for 100 and results in moderate side effects. The TPP change over 10 years is a decrease, 
        and drug resistance percentages below 20% for all three drugs. 
    </p>

    <h2>
      Our Design Choices
    </h2>
    <p>
      We chose to prioritize two criteria: TPP change and parasite drug resistance. This was due to a number of factors. Firstly, we wanted to especially prioritize TPP change, so that the medicine would actually be effective 
      in curing malaria. We chose to prioritize parasite drug resistance because it was the most feasible criteria to meet - we were unable to achieve mild or better side effects without costs and drug resistance ballooning, and
      were unable to achieve a cost under $2000 without incurring severe side effects and high drug resistance.
